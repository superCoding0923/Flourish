# Flourish

This is a hackathon project initialized by Tiffany (GitHub: [Tiffany0410](https://github.com/Tiffany0410)), Leon (GitHub: [rainyuxuan](https://github.com/rainyuxuan)), and Edward (GitHub: [EdwardHaoranLee](https://github.com/EdwardHaoranLee))

This project, Flourish, is started as the [group project](https://devpost.com/software/flourish-v8a513) of [NewHacks 2020](https://newhacks2020.devpost.com), co-sponsored by IEEE and University of Toronto. The theme of this Hackathon was life convenience. Around this topic, we designed and implemented a plant and flower management mobile app. There are three major functionalites: 
- Users can take pictures or upload images of their green plants. Then, Flourish will identify the plant and give the name and information, such as care intructions or water and light preference, of the plant using image recognition from the public API [plant.id](https://plant.id).
- Users can also create their plant records. Each piece of record can contain information such as the species, the name given by the user, the frequency of watering fertilizing, and a brief introduction.
- After setting up the records and reminders, Flourish will automatically generate new reminders of watering and fertilizing to users' plants, so they can check the phone and know which plant needs to be "flourished" today or this week.

Flourish is developed using React-Native framwork, working on both iOS and Android.
